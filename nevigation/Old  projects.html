    <h1><u><em>My First Day At School</em></u></h1>
    <p>Our lives are full of new events which we experience on different days. Similarly, going to <b>school</b> for the first time is also memorable.<br>
         How can one forget their <b>first day</b>, it is only natural to remember the day, no matter <b>good or bad</b>.
             <h2><u><em>A New Experience</em></u></h2>
         <p>My first day at <b>school</b> was a completely new experience for me. It is because the atmosphere completely changes for any <b>child</b>.<br>
         You always stay in the comfort and safety of your own <b>home</b>.</p>
         <h3><em><u>My Sister is My Saviour</u></em></h3>
         <p>My advantage was that my <strong>sister</strong> was also studying in the same <b>School</b>. She was in <b>7 <sup>th</sup></b> class so she was my senior. During recess, <br> I was starting to miss <b>my parents</b> so I got teary-eyed.,
        But, then my sister came to meet me and I feel she was no less than a <b>saviour</b> for me that day. <br> She took permission from the <b>teacher</b> to take me out and I went with her to the <b>playground</b>.</p> <hr>
